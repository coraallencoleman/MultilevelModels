#Multilevel Models Class
Tuesday January 23 2018

Approach:
- Start with simple models, make sure that works, then add more complexity.
- very applied, usually start with example
- practical problems + computation

##Example: Junior School Project
782 school children
primary variables of interest: scores on a mathematics exam at age eight (x) and age eleven (y)

Question: HOw are these variables related?

###Step 1: Graph raw data (w/ jitter)


###Step 2: How to analyze?

####Simple linear regression?
y_i = beta_0 + beta_i*x_i + e_i
e_i ~ N(0, sigma^2)
SLR assumptions:
1. Linearity of residuals. There is a linear relationship between x and y.
  maybe? not necessarily.
2. Independence of residuals. i.e. All the deviations of the true observed values from expectations are independent.
  NO. There could be effects of different schools (scores within schools more similar than those between).
  Could be effects of classroom.
3. Independent and normal distribution of residuals (deviations of the true observed values from expectation are normally distributed)
4. Equal variance of residuals
  This assumption isn't met here. Variance looks larger for lower scoring students.

He fit a simple linear regression anyway and interpreted it. This is a good baseline.
Problems:
- ignored grouping. this means we don't have as much information as we could have. This could make the estimated SE smaller than it should be.

*note: use two significant figures*

What are we ignoring? (see slides for interpretation)  
- how was the data collected? Are we ignoring as grouping?  

To check this, run an independent regression for each school separately, graph lines on the same graph to see if the slopes and intercepts are different.  
But we shouldn't completely ignore test scores from other schools. We want a model that doesn't completely ignore information from other schools and schools we haven't sampled.  
Multilevel models allow sharing of information between groups.

One level of the model will say how individual student scores vary. (and could have individual-level variables)  
Next level: how do school averages vary?  (we could also have school-level variables: size, avg income)
How do we account for missing data?

####Multilevel Models
lme4 package version and lmer (see slides)

slopes and intercepts are perfectly correlated with each other, which makes some part of the specification might not be quite right.
Might be because when we model intercept (no data). Maybe could do better if looked at scores deviating from mean score (by centering + scaling scores)

fixed effects:
0.64 slope for all schools
every individual school will deviate from that by some amount
standard error is larger, reflecting the grouping inherent in the data. Estimated SE changed.
Strong evidence that hte general trend across school is not a flat line.

##Advantages of Multilevel Models
- appropriately account for additional uncertainty when there are groups among the data. *very important*
  we can use these tools to deal with this. Mixed effects models are one way, but uses a different computational engine that provides more flexibility and power.
- are efficient in the use of information
- allow estimation of the variation at different levels
- permits covariates at different levels (for example, what if we knew the gender of individual students, but also the median household income of all houese near a given school?)
- allow for inferences about new students and even about new schools. (another way to do this would be to use school as a dummy variable except that we would have had a common variance estimate. Here we don't get the benefit of SHARING between schools)

##Motivation for Multilevel Models
- proper modeling of correlation
- greater statistical efficiency in using information
- can incorporate predictors at multiple levels appropriately
SEE SLIDES

##Challenges of Multilevel Models
- model description is more complex; you need to think more
- computation is much more difficult and less standard.
- we will use simulation rather than formulas for estimation and standard error measurement
  frequentist pov:
    parameters are fixed, unknown constants
  bayesian pov:
    anything that's unknown (parameters, unobserved data) is described with probability distributions.
    Stan asks you to make some distributional assumptions, then does computation for us.
- no good textbook options because its so new.

##Nomenclature
Multilevel models are also called:
- hierarchical Models
- mixed effects Models

Multilevel models is more flexible because
- groups are not always in a perfect hierarchy. For example, students are nested in schools but crossed with time.

Mixed effects models include fixed effects and random effects. These terms become confusing when there are more than two levels in a model. Something may be fixed after conditioning but random because its based on something random.

##R Studio
- analyze data, graph data and graph results, and write English to answer questions and interpret results.
- reproducible.

##lme4 package
It's common practice to first fit models in lme4 then switch to STAN for more complexity.

##STAN
- slower than lme4 because its has to translate it into C++ then compile. It'll then run a Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo and sample.
- very powerful, but takes some expertise to use appropriately. RStan can help you learn to use STAN through R. It can also stand alone or with other languages such as Python.
- see online STAN manual for documentation.
